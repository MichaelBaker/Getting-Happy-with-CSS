Given that my list of accomplishments is in chronological order, I will be using an <span class = "important wut">ORDERED LIST</span>.

      <li name = "1908">In 1908 the two cheapest colors of metal-etching paint were matte black and high-gloss sea-foam green, which was made fashionable by Cuban independence fliers which were mistranslated by the American public as comical parodies of William Jennings Bryan's presidential campaign. I wrote a strongly worded note to Henry Ford in response to his very public deliberations as to the color to use for the Model T automobile. Thanks to me, America is able to hold it's metaphorical head high as we cruise the boardwalk in our black Model Ts, having avoided the embarrassment of having such a nancy color seen parked on every street corner.</li>
      <li name = "1929">On October 30, 1929, in response to the loss of a bet, I adopted a street urchin chosen at random by rolling a set of non-transitive dice. By gosh, that boy looked 100% like Theodore Roosevelt and would go on to bring joy to countless rural communities with his ahead-of-its-time observational comedy and one-handed card tricks.</li>
      <li name = "2000+">At some point near turn of the 21st century I gave a friend of mine, to whom I am not very close, a high five. That high five made the most satisfying <strong>pop</strong> I've ever heard. Sometimes I still hear it when I close my eyes and listen carefully.</li>
