  <h1>Yournamehere Awesome Fantastic</h1>
  <p>Why hello there, stranger. This site is about the slickest cat this end of the 'verse. That's right, you've stumbled, perhaps unwittingly, perhaps by great fortune, onto the Internet residence of Yournamehere. Despite the global reach of my reputation and the fact that your life is very likely much improved my my existence, you may not be aware of my accomplishments. Allow me to enumerate. Given that my list of accomplishments is in chronological order, I will be using an <em class = "important">ORDERED LIST</em>. The other reason for my choice of tag is that I'm not a dimwit. Following the chronological list of my accomplishments will be an <em class = "important">UNORDERED LIST</em> of other things that I am not, because I am equally not everything appearing in the list.</p>

    <li>In 1908 the two cheapest colors of metal-etching paint were matte black and high-gloss sea-foam green, which was made fashionable by Cuban independence fliers which were mistranslated by the American public as comical parodies of William Jennings Bryan's presidential campaign. I wrote a strongly worded note to Henry Ford in response to his very public deliberations as to the color to use for the Model T automobile. Thanks to me, America is able to hold it's metaphorical head high as we cruise the boardwalk in our BLACK Model Ts, having avoided the embarrassment of having such a nancy color seen parked on every street corner.</li>
    <li>On October 30, 1929, in response to the loss of a bet, I adapted a street urchin chosen at random by rolling a set of non-transitive dice. By gosh, that boy looked 100% like Theodore Roosevelt and would go on to bring joy to countless rural communities with his ahead-of-its-time observational comedy and one-handed card tricks.</li>
    <li>At some point near turn of the 21st century I gave a friend of mine, to whom I am not very close, a high five. That high five made the most satisfying <strong class = "important">pop</strong> I've ever heard. Sometimes I still hear it when I close my eyes and listen carefully.</li>
